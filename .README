# Pokédex Web App

This is an interactive Pokédex web application that uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to provide detailed information about various Pokémon. The application allows users to explore Pokémon in mini and large card views, search by name, view types, weaknesses, and evolution chains, and automatically load more Pokémon via infinite scrolling.

## Features

### Live Search
- Activates after entering at least 3 characters.
- Displays up to 10 matching results.
- Uses a debounce function to limit API requests while typing.
- Automatically resets the list when the input field is cleared.

### Lazy Loading (Infinite Scroll)
- Automatically loads more Pokémon when the user scrolls near the bottom of the page.
- Optimized for mobile devices with a robust scroll check.
- Prevents duplicate loading using a loading flag.

### Card Views
- **Mini Cards**: compact overview with name and image.
- **Big Cards**: detailed view including type, weaknesses, and evolution.
- Cards are colored dynamically based on Pokémon type.

### Type Colors
- Each Pokémon type is associated with a specific color (e.g., Fire = orange).
- Colors are applied to cards for visual distinction.

### Evolution Display
- Shows up to 3 stages of evolution.
- Loads evolution names and official images automatically.

### Loading Spinner
- Appears during actions like search, scrolling, or initialization.
- Stays visible for 1 second to enhance user awareness.

### Scroll-to-Top Button
- Appears when scrolling down.
- Smoothly scrolls the user back to the top of the page when clicked.
